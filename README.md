# Identity-and-Discrimination-in-the-Rental-Housing-Market-An-Economic-Analysis
This project investigates gender discrimination in Kolkata's rental housing market using 398 applications. It tests if male or female applicants receive more callbacks and examines the impact of monetary incentives and educational information. The baseline model assesses gender-based discrimination, while the full model includes additional treatments. Results show no significant gender difference in callback rates, with incentives slightly reducing the gender gap.
### Objective:
Examine gender discrimination in the rental housing market and determine if monetary incentives or educational information can mitigate the gender gap in callback rates.
### Hypotheses:
* Females are more likely to receive callbacks compared to males.
* Callbacks increase when the landlord and applicant share the same gender.
* Gender gap in callbacks reduces with monetary incentives or educational information.
* Callback frequency increases with monetary incentives and/or educational information.
### Methodology:
* Conducted an online experiment with 398 applications sent to landlords.
* Divided into two groups: Male and Female applicants.
* Used fictitious profiles to send SMS inquiries to landlords.
* Four treatments tested: baseline (name only), monetary incentive, educational information, and both monetary incentive and educational information.
#### Data Collection:
* Applications sent from May to July 2022.
* Focused on rental properties in Kolkata.
* Collected responses through SMS, WhatsApp, and phone calls.
### Findings:
* No significant difference in overall callback rates between male and female applicants.
* Females received a higher frequency of responses compared to males.
* No significant landlord bias towards applicants of the same gender.
* Monetary incentives and educational information slightly reduced the gender gap in callbacks, but not significantly.
### Model Building:
* Two models have been made keeping callback frequency as dependent variable.
* For the baseline model Poisson Regression has been used and only 98 data points from the baseline treatment were included.
* Whereas for full model was regressed with Negative Binomial. Here total 398 datapoints were included from all 4 treatments.
### Results Summary:
**Callback Rates:**
* No significant association between applicant gender and callback likelihood.
* Females received a higher mean response rate than males.
**Gender Bias:**
* No significant preference for same-gender applicants by landlords.
**Impact of Incentives:**
* Monetary incentives and educational information marginally reduced the gender gap in callbacks, though not statistically significant.
### Conclusion:
The study provides insights into gender-based discrimination in Kolkata's rental housing market and the potential of incentives to influence landlord responses. Despite higher callback frequencies for females, the overall effect of gender on receiving callbacks was not significant, indicating complex dynamics in landlord decision-making.
